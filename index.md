### The Mission: Transparency

**The Puerto Rican public sector has a transparency problem.** Corruption in the political realm is rampant, government services are hard to navigate, and public data is hard to locate.

**Part of the solution is to change how the government interfaces with its constituents and its own data** 

**This project aims to be:**
* a tool used by journalists and activists to quickly find key data points on government spending
* an API used by developers and data scientists to build data visualizations
* a **proof of concept** to inspire local municipal governments to make their data and internal work more transparent.
