# Day 0 - Setting up a game plan

///filas.casos.puedes || ///confirms.pepper.spilling
Tuesday 13 October 2020

Today is my zero'th day working on my portfolio project.\ 
A summary of what my portfolio project is about can be found\
[here](https://google.com/).

I fully expect the final product of this adventure to be very different from\
that original game plan. Let's see how it goes. 

## Priorities today

* It's time to find and clean up all the data I intend to use.
    * I will be downloading all the 2019 municipal budgets for all\
    Puerto Rico municipalities.

* I want to make sure I have a minimum viable piece of code. Anything. Just\
to start getting my feet wet. I'll be creating an instance of a Flask web app\
and an example of an initial API today.

* Lastly, I want to make sure I have a viable architecture, so I'll just be\
double-checking that.

## Finding and cleaning the data

* So all the Puerto Rico municipal budgets are available as PDFs in the\
Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget Website. The specific link is
this one: http://ogp.pr.gov/PresupuestoMunicipal

* Thankfully for me, all the pdfs are stored in a standardized URL format, so
I can probably build a quick python script to download them all.
    * I can use (this list of \
    municipalities)[https://gist.github.com/rubenvarela/8475772]\
    (thanks Ruben Varela!)
    * Going to use (this wget module)[https://pypi.org/project/wget] \
    to mimic the behavior of the bash terminal command wget \
    because that's what I'm accustomed to. `pip install wget` for this \
    following along at home.
        * **UPDATE!** Forget wget. The requests module is good enough and \
        does exactly what I need it to.
    * We'll use `pip install Unidecode` to get rid of accents when we save the
    files. just in case.
    * Ok, it's been twenty minutes making this python script and at this point
    I am aware it would have taken less time if I had just downloaded each file
    individually and patiently... maybe? I don't know.
        * I'll try to compensate for that by making this file dynamic enough
        to be used next year.
    * Okay, lesson learned. Programming is fun, but it's too fun. I have \
    to remember to make my work about the product, not about the code. \
    Taking too long on this script. Victim of a sunk cost fallacy here.
    * So, at this point, I'm just continuing because it's fun to learn. But \
    yeah, I should have just downloaded them manually. **Currently stuck
    because the OGP website is blocking my requests. I have to mimic that
    I am coming from a browser**.

* And we have finally finished building the python script! It worked like a \
charm, not gonna lie. Certainly, downloading them manually would have been \
a lot faster, but-- and this is very important-- **the reason IÂ´m doing this \
project in the first place is to put my coding skills to practice.** So, \
yeah, for the sake of progress on my project, I can't take this long on \
side mini-projects every day, otherwise I'll never finish. **BUT!** I must \
say, I am very, very satisfied and feel very accomplished about the fact that \
I took an hour of my time today to learn how to build a basic web scraping \
script.

## Work Completed for the Day

* All municipal budgets have been downloaded.

## Intended Work for Today I Failed to Complete

* I have not cleaned up the data, and after downloading the bunch, **I am now \
very aware it will likely take several days to clean up the data.**

* I did not build a basic Flask app. I shall do this tomorrow.

## Conclusions for the Day

* A side mini-project for learning's sake is good-- in moderation. Best not \
to repeat a day like this until I at least have an MVP.

* Sometimes, it's best just to keep your approaches simple

## Improvements for tomorrow

* Tomorrow, I will start writing these diaries in Spanish. I've chosen that \
**it matters more to me that my progress diary help inspire other Puerto Rican \
and Latin American coders than it matters to me that I show an employer my \
work flow.**

* I will also start including timestamps for all my posts on this diary. That \
way, I can demonstrably show how much time I'm working on things and how much
total time I've spent working on the project.
